"CROWD PREDICTION FOR BUSLINES USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE"
Project Proposal:
 The main purpose of this project is to reduce accidents due to overcrowding .
• Reduce bus waiting period for passengers and also to reduce operational cost for public transport companies.
• Predicting the number of passengers on bus line for public transport companies like a KSRTC.
